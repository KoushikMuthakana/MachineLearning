# Data Preprocessing
Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is an important step of solving every machine learning problem. Most of the datasets used with Machine Learning problems need to be processed / cleaned / transformed so that a Machine Learning algorithm can be trained on it.
Data Preprocessing is processing of raw data into Datasets (meaningful data)


Why Data Preprocessing? 


Real world data are generally


1.	Incomplete: lacking attribute values, lacking certain attributes of interest, or containing only aggregate data


2.	Noisy: containing errors or outliers


3.	Inconsistent: containing discrepancies in codes or names

Steps for Data Preprocessing:

  1.	Modeling Overview

  2.	Introduce Data

      I.	Import Libraries

      II.	Import Datasets

  3.	Basic Data Cleaning	
    
      I.	Dealing with Data Types

      II.	Handling Missing Data 

      III.	Handling Categorical data

  4.	Scaling the Features

  5.	Assessing the model performance
