                          	0<= hθ(x) <=1

Eg:

To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)
Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)

Types of Logistic Regression

    1. Binary Logistic Regression

           The categorical response has only two  possible outcomes. Example: Spam or Not 

    2. Multinomial Logistic Regression

          Three or more categories without ordering. Example: Predicting which food is preferred more (Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan)

    3. Ord inal Logistic Regression

          Three or more categories with ordering. Example: Movie rating from 1 to 5
