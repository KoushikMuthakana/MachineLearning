# Linear Regression 


Linear regression is used for finding linear relationship between target  and one or more predictors.

1. Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression: Simple linear regression is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables.

One is predictor or independent variable(X) and other is response or dependent variable(Y)

         Y' =β1+β2X                          

         y'=predicted label, β1= bias(y intercept) β2= slope

This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables.

Eg: Relationship between rash driving and number of road accidents by a driver is best studied through regression.
